=== Run in browser ===
The simple way is to open *index.htm* locally in your favorite browser and play with it. However, in order to use script injection and many network related features, you may want to host the entire *jsh* folder on a web server.<br>
Once you are done, you will see something similar as illustrated below.<br>
Now there are three panels, click the *Runtime Library* link, which is the last item in the left panel, and you will see a prompt at the right panel as illustrated, now you can type in javascript expressions and statements and see the result.<br>

*Needle (bookmark)* can be saved as a bookmark and used on other web pages, this is done by injecting javascript code to current web page. Note that when *index.htm* is opened locally, *Needle (bookmark)* may not work due to browser security policy.<br>
If you are running locally and using Internet Explorer, the browser may show an information bar asking if the active content should be executed depending on your browser security policy.<br>

=== Run in Windows HTA ===
If your operating system is Windows based, you may start directly by double clicking the *JSH.hta* file icon, this would bring you an HTA based shell.<br>
