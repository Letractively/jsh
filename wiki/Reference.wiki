= JSH Runtime =
=== `__builtins__` ===
All JSH related data are kept in the *`__builtins__`* global variable.<br>
*{{{__builtins__.Engine}}}* _string_<br>
*{{{__builtins__.Environment}}}* _object_<br>
*{{{__builtins__.Terminate()}}}* _function_<br>

=== `_` (underscore) ===
When running in interactive mode, an additional global variable named *`_`* _(a single underscore)_ is maintained, which always holds the last successful evaluation result.

=== `.` commands ===
These are also known as meta commands, available when running interactively in browser and HTA.<br>

.history        (show command history)
.wrap           (toggle output wrapping)

= Library API =
=== Tartarus ===
*{{{chainload(...)}}}*<br>
load scripts one by one in the given order, if the argument is a Function instead of script name String, execute the function instead.<br>
